    <string name="bio">Hi, this is a really long bio.
        I don\'t know why I\'m writing
        all of this, It\'s really late and don\'t
        know why I\'m working on this right now.
        I\'ve been binge learning android
        so that I can develop the app that I
        want to make. It\'s a really good idea
        but I\'m not sure if it will go as planned...
        This text needs to be long.\n\n\n\n
        so here\'s a few spaces \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
        aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand more spaces \n\n\n\n\n\n
        I guess it\'s worth a shot. Now let me finish with this really, really, reallllllllllly long line.
